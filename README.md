# Getting_and_Cleaning_data_project

Project work for Coursera course Getting and Cleaning data

## R script function

Create an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

## Dependencies and Steps to run the script

Install and load the package "data.table"

Set the working directory and then run the script "run_analysis.R" and it will generate a new file called "tidy_data.txt" in your working
directory.
